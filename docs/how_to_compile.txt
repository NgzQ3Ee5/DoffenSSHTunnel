Tested with Qt 4.5 at the time of writing.


On Windows with Visual Studio 2003,2005,2008:
- Install Qt 4.3.2, compile it and set the environment variables correctly
  as per the Qt documentation (QTDIR, QMAKESPEC, PATH).
- Go to the "build" directory in this source and open a command line there.
- Run vcvars32.bat to setup the Visual Studio variables.
- Run "qmake -tp vc" to create the project file.
- Open the project file and save the solution (it will ask the first time
  you compile).
- Compile.
- You will need plink.exe in the DoffenSSHTunnel.exe directory to make it run.

Caveats:
- VC2008 Express performs full link
debug/DoffenSSHTunnel.exe not found or not built by the last incremental link; performing full link
=> Go to : Project->DoffenSSHTunnel Properties->Configuration Properties->Linker->General
=> Enable Incremental Linking : Yes (/INCREMENTAL)


On Linux:
- Install Qt 4.3.2, apt-get it or compile it and set the environment
  variables as per the Qt documentation (QTDIR, MKSPECS, PATH).
  "sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev" for debian-based systems.
- Go to the "build" directory in this source.
- Run "qmake".
- Run "make".


To clean the source:
- In the build directory, delete everything except build.xml and DoffenSSHTunnel.pro
